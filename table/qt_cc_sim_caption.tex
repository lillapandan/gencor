This table displays results from simulations with one quantitative trait and one binary trait. 
In order to simulate case/control ascertainment, we used simulated genotypes
with an LD block LD structure ($r^2=0$ or $r^2=1$). In all simulations, the sample size for the QT GWAS
was 1000, the binary trait GWAS had 1000 cases and 1000 controls, and 500 individuals 
appeared in both studies. 

From left to right, the columns are prevalence of the binary trait, estimated heritability of
the quantitative trait, estimated heritability of the binary trait (on the liability 
scale) and estimated genetic correlation. Estimates are averages taken across 100 simulations 
per prevalence. Standard deviations (in parentheses) are calculated as the empirical standard
deviation across 100 simulations. 

These simulations confirm that LD Score regression gives consistent estimates of genetic correlation between an ascertained binary phenotype and a quantitative phenotype, even for binary phenotypes with low prevalence (1\%) and even with sample overlap.
