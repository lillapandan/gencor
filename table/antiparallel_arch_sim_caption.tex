This table displays simulations with MAF- and LD-dependent genetic architecture where the MAF- and LD- dependence was in opposite directions for each phenotype, and genetic correlation did not vary with MAF or LD. Precisely, per-allele effect sizes for the first phenotype were drawn from a normal distribution so that the variance of per-allele effect sizes were uncorrelated with MAF, and variants with LD Score below 100 were $4\times$ enriched for heritability. Per-allele effect sizes for the second phenotype were drawn from a normal distribution so that the variance of per-allele effect size followed $\sqrt{p(1-p)}$, where $p$ is MAF, and variants with LD Score above 100 were $4\times$ enriched for heritability. Otherwise, the parameters of these simulations were the same as in \ref{parallel}
These simulations demonstrate that naive LD Score regression can give approximately accurate genetic correlation estimates even in situations where the heritability and genetic covariance estimates are badly biased, so long as genetic correlation does not depend on MAF or LD. In addition, these simulations demonstrate that MAF- and LD-binned LD Score regression can give accurate estimates of heritability and genetic covariance even for genetic architectures with MAF- and LD-dependence.
