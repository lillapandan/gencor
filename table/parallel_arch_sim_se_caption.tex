This table compares the block jackknife standard errors from ldsc (denoted $\widehat{se}$, which represents the mean standard error estimate across 100 simulation replicates) in the simulations from \ref{parallel} to the empirical standard deviations of the parameter estimates (denoted $sd$) across 100 simulation replicates. The block jackknife standard errors closely match the empirical standard deviations. This confirms that block jackknife standard error estimates are approximately unbiased even with locally correlated error terms, so long as the block size is sufficiently large.
