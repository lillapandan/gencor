This table displays simulations with MAF- and LD-dependent genetic architecture where the MAF- and LD- dependence was in opposite directions for each phenotype, and additionally, genetic correlation varied with MAF or LD. The parameters of these simulations were the same as \ref{antiparallel}, except that genetic correlation was 0.2 for variants with LD Score less than 100 and 0.8 for variants with LD Score greater than 100. 

These simulations show that if genetic correlation (as opposed to just heritability or covariance) varies with MAF or LD, then all estimates from naive LD Score regression maybe be badly biased; however, MAF- and LD-binned LD Score regression give approximately correct results, at the cost of slightly higher standard error.
